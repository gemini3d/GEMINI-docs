# CMake Dependency Graphs

CMake can
[generate dependency graphs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakeGraphVizOptions.html)
of code languages that CMake supports, including
[Fortran](https://www.scivision.dev/fortran-dependency-graph).
We have created a Python program that converts the GraphViz .dot files generated by CMake into SVG or PNG files:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scivision/cmakeutils
pip install -e cmakeutils

python -m cmakeutils.graph ~/gemini/gfx
```

We present a snapshot of these SVG files in [gfx/](./gfx) directory.
SVG files are vector graphics that display in modern web browsers--PNGs are rasterized and hence of finite resolution.
These must be manually generated.
The dependency graph varies depending on which Gemini3D program options are enabled.
Also, using system libraries vs. self-built libraries can possibly make trivial changes in the dependency graph.
